# Context7 Retrieval Guide

Use Context7 for semantic retrieval over a finalist's repository code and official documentation. It complements live GitHub discovery; it does not replace candidate discovery or guarantee coverage of every GitHub repository.

## Tool sequence

1. Call the Context7 library-resolution tool with the exact `owner/repository`, canonical project name, and the confirmed user goal.
2. Select the result whose source repository and project identity match. Do not select solely by a similar display name.
3. Call the Context7 documentation-query tool with focused, answerable questions.
4. Preserve useful source URLs returned by Context7 for the final response.

Tool names may be exposed as `resolve-library-id` and `query-docs`, with an MCP namespace added by the host. Use the Context7 tools provided by the dependency rather than guessing HTTP endpoints.

## Query plan

Ask only questions needed for the decision. Useful patterns include:

- `What is this project's primary product purpose and intended user?`
- `How does the official installation documentation deploy it with Docker?`
- `Where is capability X documented or implemented?`
- `What components, services, databases, or queues are required in production?`
- `What official integration point supports protocol/API X?`
- `What limitations, migration requirements, or breaking changes affect this use case?`

For composed solutions, query the shared interface from both sides. For example, retrieve the producer's S3 support and the consumer's S3 configuration separately before calling them compatible.

## Coverage fallback

When resolution fails:

1. Retry once with the canonical name and exact GitHub URL.
2. Prefer read-only GitHub MCP tools to search code and read README files, official documentation, releases, and the smallest relevant source slices; use other GitHub or browser tools if needed.
3. State the conclusion normally, but do not label it as Context7-derived.

When Context7 itself is unavailable, continue with live GitHub and official sources. Mention the degradation only when it materially limits the recommendation.

## Retrieval discipline

- Do not dump entire Context7 responses into the answer.
- Do not ask one giant question covering all candidates and criteria.
- Do not infer runtime behavior from a dependency name alone.
- Prefer current official documentation for setup and compatibility claims.
- Use code context for architecture or implementation questions, not as a substitute for product judgment.
- Treat GitHub repository and code search as query-driven lexical retrieval, not semantic retrieval.
